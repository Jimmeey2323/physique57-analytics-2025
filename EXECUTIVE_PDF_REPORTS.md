## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **jsPDF**: Core PDF generation library
- **jspdf-autotable**: Professional table rendering
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **React**: Component integration

### Data Processing
1. **Automatic filtering**: Previous month data calculated dynamically
2. **Location-specific**: Each PDF filters by its location
3. **Comprehensive metrics**: Aggregates across all data sources:
   - Sales data
   - Session data
   - Payroll data
   - New client data
   - Leads data
   - Discount data
   - Late cancellation data

### Performance
- **Sequential generation**: PDFs generated one at a time to avoid memory issues

- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback if AI summaries fail
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during generation

## Customization Options

### Enabling/Disabling AI Summaries
In `executivePDFService.ts`:
```typescript
const config: ReportConfig = {
  locationName: location,
  monthYear: monthYear,
  includeSummaries: true  // Set to false to disable AI summaries
};
```

### Styling Customization
Color palette defined in `executivePDFService.ts`:
```typescript
const COLORS = {
  primary: '#1e3a8a',    // Deep blue
  secondary: '#7c3aed',  // Purple
  accent: '#ec4899',     // Pink
  // ... more colors
};
```

### Adding New Sections
To add a new section:
1. Create a new method in `ExecutivePDFReportGenerator` class
2. Add to the `generateReport()` method sequence
3. Update table of contents in `addTableOfContents()`

Example:
```typescript
private async addCustomSection(data: any[], config: ReportConfig) {
  this.addSectionTitle('Custom Section', 'icon-name');
  
  // Add your content here
  const metricsData = [
    ['Metric 1', 'Value 1'],
    ['Metric 2', 'Value 2']
  ];
  
  autoTable(this.doc, {
    startY: this.currentY,
    head: [['Metric', 'Value']],
    body: metricsData,
    theme: 'grid',
    headStyles: { fillColor: [30, 58, 138] }
  });
  
  this.updateCurrentY();
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: PDFs Not Downloading
**Solution**: Check browser popup blocker settings. Allow downloads from your domain.

### Issue: "Failed to generate PDF reports"
**Causes**:
- Missing data sources
- API connection issues
- Insufficient permissions

**Solution**: Check console for detailed error messages. Ensure all data hooks are loaded.

### Issue: Incomplete Data in Reports
**Solution**: Verify date filters and location selections are correct. Check that data exists for the previous month.

### Issue: AI Summaries Missing
**Causes**:
- Gemini API key not configured
- API rate limits
- Network issues

**Solution**: AI summaries are optional. Reports will still generate with basic summaries if AI fails.
